        "description": "Panels are often used in clinical settings because they’re low cost and provide high quality coverage of specific, pre-defined genomic regions of interest. While useful in certain settings, such assays are limited by their narrow focus.",
        "description2": "With ≥ 99.5% call rate across ~600 genes relevant to many disease states, the Exome+ assay enables you to run multiple panel-grade analyses with a single sample."
